# Design

## User Interface design
In order to ensure a seamless user experience, this wireframe was made to plan the functionality and layout of our app before it was developed. With simple section navigation, it has a Find Car Park section with availability and cost, a map view for parking locations, a review system, and a contact form for user questions. Using this wireframe has the benefit of saving us time and money by assisting us in identifying and resolving design flaws early. We gain from increased productivity, higher user satisfaction, and more organized and efficient development.
