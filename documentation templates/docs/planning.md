# Project Proposal

## Business Case
On this page, we’re presenting our business case for an app that assists users in finding the best designated parking spots. By ensuring that users can easily locate appropriate parking, we’ll create a detailed plan that covers the problem statement, the benefits to the business, the options we’ve explored, the risks we anticipate, and the scope of the project. This plan will help us identify any possible gaps or issues, making sure the app aligns with what users really need. If we don’t have a clear plan, we might face challenges that could hinder the app’s effectiveness for our users. The objective of Interactive Parking Finder is to help drivers locate parking spaces since it solves their primary difficulty in urban areas. By utilizing Bristol Open Data 'Designated Parking Spaces' dataset, the application helps users locate nearby parking spots effectively and minimises parking search time.

### Problem statement
The issue of car parking in Bristol has become a significant challenge for both residents and visitors, with increased demand for spaces in an urban setting. The challenge for Bristol City Council is to balance the demands of local companies, commuters, and residents with managing the city's limited parking supplies. A problem statement states the problems that me and Ayub have noticed. By stating these problems beforehand, we can more effectively plan and come up with solutions before they become bigger headaches. 
Our Designated Parking Spot business is all about simplifying the process of drivers finding and reserving parking spaces. As cities keep on getting busier and the need for parking keeps on growing, I honestly believe our app is going to be a lifesaver for users as it will enable them to find available parking in no time. As cities seek better traffic and parking management, our application will not only save users time but also cut fuel usage and decrease the annoyance of trying to find a parking spot..

### Business benefits
Designated parking areas provide procedures and increased safety for the general public, and environmentally they help the economy by reducing pollution. Additional benefits are it is convenient knowing where, and when to park in addition to stress from getting a ticket, or wondering if you are in the right place. It also Improves traffic because designated parking reduces congestion. As well as this, It is good for Customer satisfaction as customers find it easier to park and shop. There are also Emergency access options, which are marked, and provide response time for emergency cars.

### Options Considered
What are some other customer options or leading products that address the same needs?
One other option is the app PayByPhone which addresses the same needs and allows users to find parking around them and also pay for it through the app as well. 

During the planning process, we should consider various possibilities for our users. Otherwise, we risk creating an app that doesn't really work for them—so they won't find it as useful to use to locate designated parking.
One main question to ask is: What are some existing apps or services that help users locate parking? Understanding the competition helps us identify what's already working and how we can improve.
Another important question is: Are the parking spots compatible with all vehicle types? For example, some spots may be too small for larger vehicles. Our app should provide this information clearly.

We’ve also considered: Is the parking spot already occupied? Users need real-time updates on availability to avoid wasting time driving to a full lot.
Cost is another factor: Is the parking spot free or paid? Users want to know in advance if they need to pay so that they can be prepared.

We also ask: Can users reserve a spot through the app? Booking ahead of time enables users to prepare in advance, especially in crowded areas where parking space is limited.

Finally, we question: Are all listed spots actually free when needed? Correct availability generates trust and makes the application genuinely helpful.
Taking these options into account, we can construct a reliable, user-friendly parking solution.

### Expected Risks
One of the risks would be that we are liable for misinformation. For example, if the user is uses our website and gets fined through incorrect data, they may blame our website. As well as this, mapping errors may frustrate users.

## Project Scope
Scope of the System of Interest. Include a bullet list of things from your context diagram that are in scope.

The application primarily focuses on identifying parking locations within a user-specified radius, displaying them visually on an interactive map, and providing routing information from the user's current location to a chosen parking spot. Additional details like parking costs or live availability are currently outside the scope but can be future enhancements. 

A context diagram represents all external entities that may interact with a system. It pictures the system at the centre, with no details of its interior structure, surrounded by all its interacting systems, environments and activities.

Key Components
	Center Circle: Parking Finder - Application
	External Entities: User, API (Source of Data), Leafjet.js (Library for Mapping)
Arrows, To show the flow of the application
