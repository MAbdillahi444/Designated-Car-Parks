# Project Proposal

## Business Case
The objective of Interactive Parking Finder is to help drivers locate parking spaces since it solves their primary difficulty in urban areas. By utilizing Bristol Open Data 'Designated Parking Spaces' dataset, the application help users locate nearby parking spots effectively and minimizing parking search time.

### Problem statement
TODO: The issue of car parking in Bristol has become a significant challenge for both residents and visitors, with increased demand for spaces in an urban setting. The challenge for Bristol City Council is to balance the demands of local companies, commuters, and residents with managing the city's limited parking supplies

### Business benefits
TODO: List high-level benefits that this product will provide.

### Options Considered
TODO: What are some other customer options or leading products that address the same needs?

### Expected Risks
TODO: What are the main risks of this project?

## Project Scope
TODO: Scope of the System of Interest. Include a bullet list of things from your context diagram that are in scope.

The application primarily focuses on identifying parking locations within a user-specified radius, displaying them visually on an interactive map, and providing routing information from the user's current location to a chosen parking spot. Additional details like parking costs or live availability are currently outside the scope but can be future enhancements. 

A context diagram represents all external entities that may interact with a system. It pictures the system at the center, with no details of its interior structure, surrounded by all its interacting systems, environments and activities.
