# Implementation

## Introduction
Introduction
To implement designated car parks, we employed the use of Bristol Open Data statistics, which have important details like location, availability, and cost. The statistics help to make the process simple, whereby users can effectively find parking space. While the dataset in general is credible, there will be errors on occasions that must be updated constantly and checked to maintain accuracy. A Bristol Open Data API was included to enable seamless access to the data so that it is readily usable by third parties. The user interface was also implemented with usability, offering a seamless and fluid experience to users searching for parking bays.

## Software Architecture
Reasons to use these tools
HTML, CSS and JavaScript are used because of their strong general compatibility and user-friendly attributes as well as programming flexibility. The application depends heavily on HTML for its structure and content while CSS gives absolute control over design elements alongside responsiveness features and JavaScript delivers necessary dynamic interactions together with Application Programming Interface features that make real-time functions possible.

Use Case 1: Front End Layer
User views and interacts with the charging station interface.
Main Flow:
User opens the central hub on the app.
System displays charging station status and availability.
User selects a station for more information.
System displays a map interface with locations and real-time availability.
User initiates a charging session by selecting a parking spot.
System allows the user to view and manage the session.
User manages profile settings, payment methods, and usage history through the profile management feature.
Postcondition: The user can successfully interact with the system and complete the task.

Use Case 2: Analytic and Reporting
Generate and view reports on charging station usage and performance.
Main Flow:
Admin logs into the analytics section of the system.
System collects data on station usage, such as frequency and duration of usage.
Admin generates a report showing charging station utilization.
Admin reviews performance metrics in order to evaluate the efficiency of the stations.
Admin exports or shares the report accordingly.
Postcondition: The report is created, reviewed, and potentially acted on based on insights from the data.
