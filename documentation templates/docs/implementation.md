# Implementation

## Introduction
Introduction
To implement designated car parks, we employed the use of Bristol Open Data statistics, which have important details like location, availability, and cost. The statistics help to make the process simple, whereby users can effectively find parking space. While the dataset in general is credible, there will be errors on occasions that must be updated constantly and checked to maintain accuracy. A Bristol Open Data API was included to enable seamless access to the data so that it is readily usable by third parties. The user interface was also implemented with usability, offering a seamless and fluid experience to users searching for parking bays.

## Project Structure

## Software Architecture
Reasons to use these tools
HTML, CSS and JavaScript are used because of their strong general compatibility and user-friendly attributes as well as programming flexibility. The application depends heavily on HTML for its structure and content while CSS gives absolute control over design elements alongside responsiveness features and JavaScript delivers necessary dynamic interactions together with Application Programming Interface features that make real-time functions possible.





## Bristol Open Data API
TODO: Document each query to Bristol Open Data




TODO: Explain how each use case works by providing step-by-step screenshots for each use case. This should be based on a tested scenario.
