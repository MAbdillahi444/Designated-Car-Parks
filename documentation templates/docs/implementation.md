# Implementation

## Introduction
This chapter introduces how this software is implemented. Implementation contains all the details which are required to make the system operational. We have also discussed the development, tools and technologies to implement the system.

## Project Structure
Tools and Technologies
The following tools and technologies are used to build the software.
•	HTML
•	CSS
•	JavaScript
•	Bristol Open Data API

## Software Architecture
Reasons to use these tools
HTML, CSS and JavaScript are used because of their strong general compatibility and user-friendly attributes as well as programming flexibility. The application depends heavily on HTML for its structure and content while CSS gives absolute control over design elements alongside responsiveness features and JavaScript delivers necessary dynamic interactions together with Application Programming Interface features that make real-time functions possible.





## Bristol Open Data API
TODO: Document each query to Bristol Open Data




TODO: Explain how each use case works by providing step-by-step screenshots for each use case. This should be based on a tested scenario.
